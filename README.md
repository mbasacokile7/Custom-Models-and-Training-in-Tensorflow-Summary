# Custom-Models-and-Training-in-Tensorflow-Summary
A summary on how to building custom objects using Tensorflow. In addition how to creating custom training loops in Tensorflow
The notebook covers some concepts in depth but the Book is always as a better alternative. This was done as a learning exercise. Hope you find it useful

Here are some of the concepts that are coverd in the Notebook:

## Tensorflow Architecture

The Tensorflow architecture is discussed and it is noted how vast it truly is. However, in its vastness, for 95% of the time, the author states we will be using the high-level API and only 5% of the time will there ever be a use for the low-level API.

In addition to this, Tensorflow Operations are discussed in addtion to being discussed. Therefafter a basic and fundemental discussion on how to use Tensorflow is undertaken, with exerciers on how to create tensors, how to use Tensorflow with Numpy. The types errors you can expect and how to solve of them and also the types of tensors that Tensorflow supports. 

## Building Custom Models and Training Algorithms

Not gonna lie, I was abit overwhelmed with this section. However I tried my best to summarise it as best I could. I also realised that I will continually use this notebook and revise , while I am also reading the book again whenever I need to review something. So don't take it as being set in stone. YET, LOL.

Anyway,in this section of the notebook, the following was covered:

### 1. Custom Loss Functions

### 2. Custom Activation Functions, Initializers and Regularizers

### 3. Custom Metrics

### 4. Custom Layers

### 5. Custom Models
I did not cover the custom training loop as currently I did properly understand some of the concepts. I need to further improve my Pythin programming skills, then I will go back.

NOTE TO SELF: SLOW AND STEADY WINS EVERY TIME.
